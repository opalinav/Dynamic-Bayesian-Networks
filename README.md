# Dynamic-Bayesian-Networks
As an undergraduate research in the Bathe BioNanoLab at MIT, this project is meant to test the scaling laws of using static Bayesian networks to infer molecular pathways from high-thorouput proteomic data. The code is written in R, and uses the BNLearn package to produce bayesian networks from simulated data. Work on developing dynamic Bayesian networks for neuronal pathways is currently in progress.
